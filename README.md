I am currently using the database at Chartlyrics.com for my lyrical queries. At the comment I am having issues 
maintaining a connection with their server. For this reason the application currently only searches a single city in
a given run. I have contacted Chartlyrics and I am hoping they will grant me permission, but otherwise I will seek a 
separate database, on someone else's server or possibly on a freely downloadable database on my own server.
