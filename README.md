I am currently using the database at Chartlyrics.com for my lyrical queries. At the moment I am having issues 
maintaining a connection with their server. For this reason the application currently only searches a single city in
a given run. In the meantime, I am looking for a new database, on someone else's server or possibly on a freely downloadable database on my own server.
